# Student-Result-Prediction-System
The Student Result Prediction System is a simple Artificial Intelligence–based project designed to predict students’ academic performance using basic machine learning techniques. The system analyzes factors such as attendance, class test marks, assignments, and internal assessments.
## Project Proposal


**Project Title:** Student Result Prediction System

---

## 1. Introduction

The Student Result Prediction System is a simple Artificial Intelligence (AI)–based project that focuses on predicting students’ academic performance using basic machine learning techniques. Educational institutions often need an early understanding of student performance so that proper guidance can be provided in time. This project uses previous student data to find patterns and predict final academic results in a simple and understandable way.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

In most cases, student performance is evaluated only after final examinations. This approach does not help teachers identify weak students early. As a result, students who need extra support are often noticed too late. Therefore, there is a need for a system that can predict student results in advance using internal assessment data.

## 3. Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* To build a simple AI-based system for predicting student results
* To analyze basic academic factors such as attendance, class tests, assignments, and internal assessments
* To apply easy and understandable machine learning algorithms
* To help teachers identify students who may need additional academic support at an early stage

---

## 4. Methodology

The project will be completed by following these simple steps:

* **Data Collection:** Student-related data such as attendance, class test marks, assignments, and internal assessment scores will be collected
* **Data Preprocessing:** The collected data will be cleaned and prepared for use in the model
* **Model Selection:** A basic machine learning algorithm such as Linear Regression or Decision Tree will be used
* **Training and Testing:** The model will be trained using previous data and tested for accuracy
* **Result Prediction:** The system will predict student performance based on the given inputs

---

## 5. Tools and Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
* **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

---

## 6. Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, the following outcomes are expected:

* A simple and working student result prediction system
* Reasonably accurate prediction of student academic performance
* Better understanding of the use of AI in the education sector
* Early identification of students who may be at academic risk

---

## 7. Project Timeline (Duration: 4 Weeks)

* **Week 1:** Understanding the project requirements and collecting basic student data
* **Week 2:** Cleaning the data and selecting important features
* **Week 3:** Applying a basic machine learning model and checking the results
* **Week 4:** Final analysis, report preparation, and project submission

## 8. Conclusion

The Student Result Prediction System shows how Artificial Intelligence can be applied in a simple and practical way in education. This project helps predict student performance using basic machine learning methods and internal assessment data. In the future, the system can be improved further by using larger datasets and more advanced AI techniques.
